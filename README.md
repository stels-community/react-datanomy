# react-datanomy

### This is not a yet another state manager. This is just a helper library for organize you state management, using features, already present in the React.

[![Test and build](https://github.com/stels-community/react-datanomy/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stels-community/react-datanomy/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is most clear way for manage state in React.js, with unnecessary of writing extra excess code, allowing to keep you attention on what you do, instead how

#### Preferencies:

1. Super small: 870 bytes ungzipped!
2. Support both, class and functional components
3. Provide uniform bus, used universally throught all you components tree
4. Without side dependencies - only React enough
5. Have no complex code constructions - very ease to use

## Installation:

```
npm i react-datanomy
```
or
```
yarn add react-datanomy
```
## API:

Datanomy receive **initialState**, **reducers** and optionally **scenarios** and returns array with **StoreProvider**, **StoreHook** and **StoreContext**. **StoreProvider** supply universal structure, named **SAS Bus**, and then **StoreHook**, **StoreContext.Consumer**, or **contextType** via **StoreContext**, consume it in the next unified form:

```js
[currentState, memoizedActions, memoizedScripts]
```

**SAS Bus** (**SAS** from [**S**tate, **A**ctions, **S**cripts]) acts as data bus in the electronic, or like building infrastructere, where independend from architecture complexity, each room can be connected to electricity, water, internet, security system, gas, etc. - to the any network, which independend from others and also paved through whole building. According to that analogy, React context play a cable duct role.

**initialState** is a starting store state.

**reducers** is a hash of clear functions, indexed by actions names, which receives one or two arguments: **currentState** and optional **payload** and returns **newState**.

**scenarios** is a function, which receive **getState** method and **actions** in arguments and returns a hash with **scripts**.

**getState** is a function, which allways return cureent actual state inside **scripts**

**currentState** is an current actual state, returned from useReducer inside **Datanomy**.

**acrions** is a memoized hash of methods, which formally wrappers for **dispatch**, returned from useReducer, called with action name in `type` field and optional **payload** from **action** argument.

**scripts** is a  memoized hash of methods, which can receives optional **payload** and returns nothing. They are can be regular, or async functions, and contains a logic of any complexity, which allways have an access to the current actual state by using **getState**, and call any **actions**, which are closured from **scenarios** method scope.

**StoreProvider** is component, which wrap React Context.Provider and supply SAS Bus to his value argument

**StoreHook** is a wrapper for a regular React useContext, with **StoreContext** as argument

**StoreContext** is a regular React Context, created using createContext, called with **initialState** as argument

## Usage:

### 1. Create you store module:

`file: src/stores/counterStore.js`
```js
// Import createDatanomy from react-datanomy:
import { createDatanomy } from 'react-datanomy'

// Declare you initial state:
const initialState = {
  counter: 0,
  someData: [],
}

// Declare state reducers:
const reducers = {
  increment: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 }),
  decrement: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 }),
  add: (state, payload) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter + payload }),
  sub: (state, payload) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter - payload }),
  reset: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: 0 }),
}

// Optionally declare some complex scenarios:
const scenarios = (getState, actions) => {
  derivedAdd: async (payload) => {
    console.log(getState().counter) // for example 10
    await new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(acttions.add(payload)), 100)
    })
    console.log(getState().counter) // 10 + payload
  },
}

// Call createDatanomy with above declarations and export it retuns:
export const [ 
  CounterProvider, 
  useCounter,
  CounterContext
] = createDatanomy(initialState, reducers, scenarios)
```

#### Same, using typescript:
```tsx
// Additionally import Treducers and TScenarios types:
import { TReducers, TScenarios, createDatanomy } from 'react-datanomy';
 
// Declare you store interface
interface TCounterStore = {
  counter: number;
  someData: Array<any>;
};

// Type initial state using you store interface
const initialState: TCounterStore = {
  counter: 0,
  someData: [],
};

// Type reducers, using TReducers with store interface as generic argument
const reducers: TReducers<TCounterStore> = {
  increment: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 }),
  decrement: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 }),
  add: (state, payload) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter + payload }),
  sub: (state, payload) => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter - payload }),
  reset: (state) => ({ ...state, counter: 0 }),
};

// Type scenarios, using TScenarios with store interface as generic argument
const scenarios: TScenarios<TCounterStore> = (getState, actions) => {
  derivedAdd: async (payload) => {
    console.log(getState().counter) // for example 10
    await new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(acttions.add(payload)), 100)
    })
    console.log(getState().counter) // 10 + payload
  },
};

export const [ 
  CounterProvider, 
  useCounter,
  CounterContext
// Probide store interface as generic argument to the createDatanomy
] = createDatanomy<TCounterStore>(initialState, reducers, scenarios)
```

### 2. Import and connect You store provider to the DOM branch, or whole app
`file: src/App.jsx`
```js
import { CounterProvider } from './store/counterStore'
import HookComponent from './components/HookComponent'
import ConsumerComponent from './components/ConsumerComponent'
import ClassComponent from './components/ClassComponent'

function App() {
  return (
    <CounterProvider>
      <div>
        <HookComponent/>
        <ConsumerComponent/>
        <ClassComponent/>
      </div>
    </CounterProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
### 3. Connect to the Store using hook in functional components:
`file: src/components/HookComponent.jsx`
```js
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useCounter } from '../store/counterStore'

function HookComponent() {
  
  // here we are just use a destructurization instead somethig like selectors in Redux, 
  // so, when unused store branches will be updated, they will not trigger a rendering 
  const [
    { counter }, 
    { increment, decrement }, 
    { derivedAdd },
  ] = useCounter()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    derivedAdd(15)
    
    // we can use actions and scripts as useEffect, useMemo, or useCallback
    // dependency for avoid exhausive deps warning. This will not trigger 
    // unwanted rerenderings, because actions and scripts are already memoized
    // without any dependencies
  }, [derivedAdd])
  
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <buttom onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <buttom onClick={decrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HookComponent;
```
### 4. Connect to the Store using Context.Consumer in functional, or class components:
`file: src/components/ConsumerComponent.jsx`
```js
import { CounterContext } from '../store/counterStore'

function ConsumerComponent() {
  return (
    <CounterContext.Consumer>
      {/* in SAS Bus we can even skip state, actions, or scripts - just 
          do not forget to preserve a coma */}
      {([
        , // <- skip unused state...
        { add, sub }, // <- and skip unused scripts
      ]) => (
        <>
          <buttom onClick={() => add(5)}>+5</button>
          <buttom onClick={() => sub(5)}>-5</button>
        </>
      )}
    </CounterContext.Consumer>
  );
}

export default ConsumerComponent;
```
#### The same as a class component
`file: src/components/ConsumerClassComponent.jsx`
```js
import { PureComponent } from 'react'
import { CounterContext } from '../store/counterStore'

class ConsumerClassComponent extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <CounterContext.Consumer>
        {([
          , 
          { add, sub }, 
        ]) => (
          <>
            <buttom onClick={() => add(5)}>+5</button>
            <buttom onClick={() => sub(5)}>-5</button>
          </>
        )}
      </CounterContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}

export default ConsumerClassComponent;
```
### 5. Connect to the Store using contextType in the class components:
`file: src/components/ClassComponent.jsx`
```js
import { PureComponent } from 'react'
import { CounterContext } from '../store/counterStore'

class ClassComponent extends PureComponent {
  
  static contextType = CounterContext;

  render() {
    
    const [
      ,
      { add, sub },
    ] = this.context
  
    return (
      <>
        <buttom onClick={() => add(10)}>+10</button>
        <buttom onClick={() => sub(10)}>-10</button>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```
## Tips and tricks

### About Single Source of Truth (SST)

Good news: SST is splitable!

It is not necessary to create one monolithic store for whole application data. When you split one big store on several specialized stores, if you follow condition of avoiding data duplicates, you several stories yet remains as splitted SST. 

For example, you can wrap different routes into providers, which connect Store, related only to relevant route, or DOM branch (such as `<AdminProvider>` to `/admin` route). A lot of discussions about providers location in a DOM tree happens in the internet, so it is a thin quiestion, but sometime it have a sense.

### getState function

In the scenarios, function `getState` always returns actual state, so if you call it, than call action, which update some field and than again call `getState`, that field will contains a new value

By the way, you can participate in discussions about [scenarios API](https://github.com/stels-community/react-datanomy/discussions/3) and [scenarios architecture](https://github.com/stels-community/react-datanomy/discussions/5)
